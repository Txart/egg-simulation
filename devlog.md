- Egg shaped curve from here: https://nyjp07.com/index_egg_E.html

$$
(x^2 + y^2)^2 = a*x^3 + (a-b)*x*y^2

- Only consider half of an egg (symmetry). In my case, because the eggo is lying down, y>0.

# TODOs
- get better fit of domain to egg shape. Right now, N_Y is not computed according to the shape, so a lot of space is wasted in the array.
